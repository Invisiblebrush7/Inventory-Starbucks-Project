Welcome to the Inventory-Starbucks-Project wiki!

This is a personal project.
This project uses Pandas and Matplotlib.

# **Inventory Improvement**

## What is it? 
I made this project as a software solution to know the status of the sales of your products. You only have to modify the excel file and the script will update. This script reads the file and displays an analysis of the sales, based on the info in your inventory. This way, you only have to make the inventory of your products and this script will tell you how much you need to buy!

### What's in the Excel file?
This file has 3 pages (The script needs these 3 pages):
* Inventory
* Expiration Dates
* Short Name for the products

In the **Inventory Page** you need to write how much of every product you have every Sunday (This is based on a Starbucks rule).

In the **Expiration Dates Page** you need to write how long your products "live". For example, an apple you sell "lives" for 15 days (this means that after 15 days, the apple will have to be removed from sale because of the expiration date).

In the **Short Name Page** you write a small name for your products. Just for simplicity.
